# About me

You may know me? I'm Rhyker!  
Or by my online alias, Ranger!  
I'm a 15 year old pupil in a highschool in the UK, Wales.  
I'm a Discord enthusiast and user. And have been since 2016  
I know my way around the site very well, and I'm ex-staff in alot of servers!  
Including [Chill & Advice](https://discord.gg/advice) a mental health community!  

I'm not very knowledgable with codeing or scripting, the only thing I enjoy having a crack at are custom commands for a bot named YAGPDB on Discord *heh*  

## Here are some facts about me! 

My pronouns are "It/Itself" though my gender is male  
I am Welsh, I can also speak the language pretty well  
I'm an avid ice & roller hockey player  
I *used* to actively make Discord servers and setup bots for people
